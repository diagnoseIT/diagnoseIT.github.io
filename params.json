{"name":"diagnoseIT","tagline":"expert-guided automatic diagnosis of performance problems in enterprise applications","body":"### Description\r\ndiagnoseIT provides an easy-to-use system for automated problem/symptom and root cause detection for Java enterprise applications. It defines a well-structured communication interface to common application performance management tools to gather the necessary metric information. Formalized expert knowledge - stored with diagnoseIT - drives the automated symptom detection and root cause identification algorithms. \r\n\r\ndiagnoseIT also optimizes the maintenance effort in keeping the instrumentation of monitoring tools at high quality. diagnoseIT will monitor the quality of instrumentation points and notify monitoring tools to remove specific instrumentations if they do not provide necessary information for symptom detection or root cause analysis. diagnoseIT will also notify the monitoring tools which specific additional instrumentation points are necessary to improve detection and root cause identification. \r\n\r\nPossible performance and functional symptoms are provided as formalized expert knowledge in diagnoseIT. No manual interaction or configuration is necessary to monitor an application. In case of a symptom being detected, the root cause detection is started. Based on formalized expert knowledge, diagnoseIT automatically - and with no user interaction - tries to detect the root cause of the symptom. All this information is provided in a easy-to-understand format to the enduser.\r\n\r\ndiagnoseIT can be set up as standalone application with monitoring tools sending the necessary metric information to the solution. diagnoseIT will also be released as library and can thus be integrated within monitoring tools to provide these features to the tools.\r\n\r\n### License\r\ndiagnoseIT is released under - to be defined\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors (sorted by last name - at least I tried)\r\nChristoph Heger (@hegerchr)\r\nAndré van Hoorn (@avanhoorn)\r\nDušan Okanović (@okism)\r\nIvan Senic (@ivansenic)\r\nStefan Siegl (@stefansiegl)\r\nAlexander Wert (@alexanderwert)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
